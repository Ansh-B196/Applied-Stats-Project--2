## 📘 Overview

This project explores how academic performance, lifestyle, and emotional factors interrelate using real survey data from students. The analysis includes data wrangling, visualization, statistical summaries, and validation of key statistical concepts such as the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**.

We conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), plotted trends, and interpreted correlations between variables like:

- 🎓 CGPA  
- 🎵 Music preferences  
- 💬 Communication with family  
- 🌙 Sleep patterns  
- 🧠 Happiness and life satisfaction  
- 📚 Number of clubs joined  
- 🧭 Life satisfaction by academic year

This project was submitted as part of our Applied Statistics coursework.
